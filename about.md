Hi people! I'm Kristel. I am currently 19 years old, and I am a sophomore majoring in computer science at the University of California, Berkeley.

As you can probably tell, I like drawing. I started bullet journalling my second semester of senior year, and I thoroughly enjoyed it! I bought a Moleskine notebook but I really regret that decision because their paper is thinner than rice paper and the ink ghosts badly. I do not recommend. 

All my drawings on this site were done on Procreate. You may be wondering, Kristel, why are you bald and hairless? Well, the answer is, I do not know how to draw hair without making it look weird. So this representation of myself will have to do.

For anyone that is curious, this site was built with [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) (code here on [Github](https://github.com/kristelfung/bullet-journal)). I am using [NetlifyCMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) to manage my content - I highly recommend it, it was very easy to configure.
